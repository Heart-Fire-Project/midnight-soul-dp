🔨 CONSTRCTION FINISHED 🔨

Again, here is the repository of **Midnight Soul's** datapack, branch "plus" this time.

Thanks to Mojang, about 2 months after we published the Reset Version, they changed datapacks... Anyway, we will just throw away the old version. In this rewrite, we will try our best to optimize all the aspects, which includes:

- An update to 1.21.4
- New lobby and features
- New balanced game feature
- ~~Chaos~~ Echo that we have saying about
- New ingame tutorial (Yep, it is back now)
……And more!

The construction is now finished, and we are looking forward to bring it up soon!
